One of my challenges is interesting because it is self-inflicted. I am more of a pioneer in my company because I go out of my way to learn modern languages and find more creative ways to integrate with our business applications. As a result, when things aren't working, it's on me to figure out what needs to happen next. The specific challenge arises from lack of good documentation on lots of old code and the nuances of working with our specific ERP.

I will have the ongoing challenge of working on this Ruby course on my own time and without an immediate use case at my current company. However, I am ready for the challenge and will do what it takes to position myself for my next career move and all the potential that would come with it. Have you found good ways to avoid burnout?
